# Lloyds Mortgage Calculator — Wireframe (Functional)

This is a lightweight React + Vite project implementing a functional mortgage calculator wireframe aligned to Lloyds requirements:
- Guided 3-step flow (Details → Options → Results)
- Real mortgage calculation (repayment and interest-only)
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Responsive layout and accessible form markup

## Requirements
- Node.js (16+ recommended) and npm

## Install & Run (local)
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run dev server
npm run dev

# open the URL shown in the terminal (typically http://localhost:5173)
```

## Build for production
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Notes
- This is a prototype/wireframe for demonstration and testing only. Not a financial recommendation.
- LocalStorage is used for input persistence. For production, replace with secure server-side persistence.
