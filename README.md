# Lloyds Mortgage Calculator — Wireframe (Functional)

This is a lightweight React + Vite project implementing a functional mortgage calculator wireframe aligned to Lloyds requirements:
- Guided 3-step flow (Details → Options → Results)
- Real mortgage calculation (repayment and interest-only)
- Auto-save to localStorage
- Responsive layout and accessible form markup

## 🌐 Live Demo

## Install & Run (local)
